I made a lot of changes in the main page. as you can see it is now php not html. I guess this is the only way to make it change correspondingly with the changes in the database.

so the option is now showing every dock that we have and it will show all available trip by default till you filter it, of course.
and now i am using the radio button to choose the trip. as it is a form. for the part  where you hit the button and the form appears, i don't think the submit button can hold to function together so i guess we need to find another way

i also make the insert page so we can input the new trip, and same for the message part.  you still need to create the table in database first thou.

 i will add the validation later, it still need adjustment but i am out of idea for now
